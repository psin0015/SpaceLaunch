# SpaceLaunch
The SpaceLaunch app fetches a list of astronauts from an online source and displays them in a list format. Upon selecting an astronaut from the list, the application renders a comprehensive information page that contains relevant details about the astronaut.

## Notes
- The app does not require any custom configuration for execution. To launch the app, select the "SpaceLaunch" scheme and a compatible device to run it on.
